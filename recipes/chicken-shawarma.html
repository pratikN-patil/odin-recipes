    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Traditional chicken shawarma is basically well-marinated chicken, layered on a vertical rotisserie or spit where
        it's slow-roasted for days--in its own juices and fat--until perfectly tender and extra flavorful! To serve it,
        the joint owner would typically shave a layer of shawarma off the spit and pile it up into a pita pocket, jazz
        it with tahini sauce and heaps upon heaps of fresh toppings!</p>
    <p><b>The secret is in the shawarma spice mixture</b>, including warm spices including cumin, coriander, turmeric,
        paprika
        and a pinch of cayenne. SO MUCH FLAVOR!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

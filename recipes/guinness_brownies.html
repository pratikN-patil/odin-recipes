    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These brownies are wonderfully rich, fudgey and the addition of Guinness adds a unique flavor.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> cooking spray</li>

        <li> 1 bottle Guinness (1 1/3 cups)</li>

        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter</li>

        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>

        <li>1 1/2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips</li>

        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature, lightly beaten</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray
                and line with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on one side. </li>

            <li>Heat Guinness in a medium saucepan over high heat until boiling. Skim any foam from the top. Reduce to a
                simmer over medium-low heat and cook until liquid has reduced to 1/2 cup, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to
                a heatproof bowl or container. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Heat butter in the same saucepan over medium heat until melted, about 4 minutes. Add sugar and cook,
                whisking constantly, until mixture is thickened and sugar is mostly dissolved, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, add chocolate, and whisk together until smooth, about 1 minute. (Mixture will be
                slightly grainy.) Gradually add reduced Guinness, whisking constantly, until batter is glossy and dark,
                about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer chocolate mixture to a large bowl, cool slightly, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add
                eggs slowly, stirring to combine after each egg, about 30 seconds. Add vanilla, stirring until combined,
                about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl and whisk together. In two batches, gently stir flour mixture
                into chocolate mixture until just combined or until no clumps remain, about 1 minute. Pour batter evenly
                into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
                Remove from the oven and let cool completely, about 1 hour. When cool, remove from pan and place on a
                cutting board, slice into squares and serve. Store in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up
                to one week.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These energy bites are a healthy take on traditional no-bake cookies. So good, and good for you! I'm asked for
        this recipe every time I make them. They're a hit with kids and adults and always go quick! I store them in the
        freezer because I think they taste best frozen, but it's not necessary.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>½ cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>½ cup ground flax seed</li>
        <li>½ cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Stir oats, chocolate chips, flax seed, peanut butter, honey, and vanilla extract together in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Roll dough into 24 balls with your hands. Arrange balls on a baking sheet and freeze until set, about 1
                hour. </li>


        </ol>
    </ul>
